(rn-highlights)=
## Release highlights

AMD ROCm 6.2 introduces some fancy new features and improves the taste of spinach.

This section also describes other highlights.

### System stability

Submerging your hardware in water improves the flow of data.

### rocDecode

It now tastes great and is less filling.

## Operating system and hardware support notes

AMD ROCm 6.2 adds the following operating system support:

* MI300A: Ubuntu 22.04.4 and RHEL 9.3
* MI300X: Ubuntu 22.04.4

Future releases will add additional operating systems to match the general offering.

For more information about the complete list of supported operating systems and hardware, see the system requirements
page for {doc}`Linux <rocm-install-on-linux:reference/system-requirements>` and
{doc}`Windows <rocm-install-on-windows:reference/system-requirements>`.

## Detailed component notes

(mivisionx)=
### MIVisionX (1.1.1)

#### Changes

* Describes changes to existing functionality or the addition of new functionality.
* You no longer need to clap to improve performance.

#### Removals

* Describes functionality or support that has been removed in this version. Quite often this information will have been noted in the Upcoming changes section
* Support for Microsoft Windows 95 has been removed.

#### Resolved issues

* Describes resolved since the previous version of this component. It should include information from earlier versions.
* Your ROCm applications can now run in the dark.

#### Optimizations

* Describes how the component has been optimized or improved.
* Works even better on a Commodore 64.

#### Known issues

* Describes known issues related to this specific component. We have a different section for the ROCm platform known issues.  
* Component 1 doesn't operate as expected with an endless loop.

#### Upcoming changes

* Describes upcoming changes that we’re very confident will be introduced. Must be careful not to overpromise (especially on release numbers or dates).
  This section should also include deprecation notices. Items in this section should be rolled forward until the change is introduced.  
* In a future release, the hardware will generate electricity instead of consuming it.

(rocblas)=
### rocBLAS (6.5.1)

#### Changes

* Describes changes to existing functionality or the addition of new functionality.
* You no longer need to clap to improve performance.

#### Optimizations

* Describes how the component has been optimized or improved.
* Works even better on a Commodore 64.

(amdsmi)=
### AMD SMI (1.2.5)

#### Changes

* Added process isolation and clean shader APIs and CLI commands.
  * `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_isolation()`
  * `amdsmi_set_gpu_process_isolation()`
  * `amdsmi_set_gpu_clear_sram_data()`
* Added the `MIN_POWER` metric to output provided by `amd-smi static --limit`.
* Updated `amismi_get_power_cap_info` to return values in uW instead of W.
* Updated Python library return types for `amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_reserved_pages` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_bad_page_info`.
* Updated the output of `amd-smi metric --ecc-blocks` to show counters available from blocks.

#### Removals

* Removed the `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_info` API from the Python library. It was removed from the C library in an earlier release.

#### Resolved issues

* `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` no longer returns junk character strings.
* `amd-smi metric --power` now correctly details power output for RDNA3, RDNA2, and MI1x devices.
* Fixed the `amdsmitstReadWrite.TestPowerCapReadWrite` test for RDNA3, RDNA2, and MI100 devices.
* Fixed an issue with the `amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_reserved_pages` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_bad_page_info` Python interface calls.

#### Optimizations

* Updated the `amd-smi monitor --pcie` output to prevent delays with the `monitor` command.

(rn-known-issues)=
## ROCm platform known issues

AMD ROCm known issues are noted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/labels/Verified%20Issue). This section also notes resolved issues.
For known issues related to individual components, review the content in [Detailed component notes](rn-components-det).

(rn-upcoming)=
## ROCm platform upcoming changes
The section notes upcoming changes related to the AMD ROCm platform. For upcoming changes related to individual components, review the content in [Detailed component notes](rn-components-det). 

* A future release will enable the use of HIPCC compiled binaries `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` by default. No action is needed by users; you may continue calling high-level Perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` will be invoked by the high-level Perl scripts. To revert to the previous behavior and invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`, set the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable to `1`.
* A subsequent release will remove high-level HIPCC Perl scripts from `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. This release will remove the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable. It will rename `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` to `hipcc` and `hipconfig` respectively. No action is needed by the users. To revert to the previous behavior, invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` explicitly.
* A subsequent release will remove `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` for HIPCC.
